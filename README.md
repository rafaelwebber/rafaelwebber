I'm Rafael Webber, a 24-year-old Computer Engineering student from Brazil. I work remotely in tech, focusing on API development and system integration. I enjoy learning new programming languages and collaborating on open-source projects.

I learn every day ‚Äî not to compete, but to grow. My code may not be perfect, but it's written with intention and constant improvement. I strive for clarity, efficiency, and purpose in every line. Being better than I was yesterday is the only metric that matters.
